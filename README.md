# InstantQueue

InstantQueue is a web application that lets you select any number of playlists from your Spotify “My Playlists,” merge them into a single playlist, and automatically play the result.

I previously created a similar service called MixJuice, but InstantQueue strips out the built-in player from MixJuice to keep things more minimal and environment-agnostic.

This app is built with Qwik.

Live Demo is [here](https://iq.fugamaru.com/)
